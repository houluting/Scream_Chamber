# Scream Chamber #

Scream Chamber is a project created by [72U](http://72u.org), an interactive sculpture that turns screams 
into visual reactions - bubbles, floating ribbons, flying pompoms, wind and a light show - for 2 Bit Circus's STEAM Carnival. 
16,000 kids in the Bay Area interacted with our amusement over a three-day weekend. 
Scream Chamber will go on a four-city tour with the STEAM Carnival in 2016 to inspire a new generation of 
young inventors through art and technology.
